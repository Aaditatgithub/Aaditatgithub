# Yoroshiku!

## I'm Aaditya. I kinda code; as of now I just wanna pass my exams. I generally like any technology that I encounter, from Windows Programming, Microsoft 365 to Web, Cloud and AIML, will see about exploring some niche stuff like CyberSec, Devops when its in my courses or maybe when its required.
