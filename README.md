" Aaditya here, kinda exploring the tech world with a laid-back vibe! ðŸ˜Ž (Since I want to ensure I pass my exams too). I'm all about diving into cool stuff like Windows Programming, Microsoft 365, Web Development, Cloud Computing, and AI/ML. Thinking about checking out Cybersecurity and DevOps down the road too."
